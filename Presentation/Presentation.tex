    \frametitle{Consumer Theory Overview}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Consumer theory is a branch of microeconomics that studies how consumers make choices about what goods and services to purchase.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
Utility: The satisfaction or pleasure consumers derive from consuming a product.\\
Budget Constraint: The limitation on consumer choices due to income and prices of goods.\\
Preferences: Individual tastes and subjective judgments that influence consumer decisions.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Rational Consumer Behavior}
    \begin{block}{Explaination}
         In classical consumer theory, consumers are assumed to be rational decision-makers.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Rationality Assumptions}
Completeness: Consumers can rank their preferences for all available options.\\
Transitivity: If option A is preferred to option B and option B is preferred to option C, then A is preferred to C.\\
Non-Satiation: More is preferred to less (i.e., consumers always want more of a good).
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Behavioral Economics}
    \begin{block}{Explaination}
         A field that combines insights from psychology and economics to understand how real-world consumers make decisions.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Departures from Rationality}
Bounded Rationality: Consumers may have limited cognitive abilities to make complex decisions.\\
Behavioral Biases: Common biases like loss aversion, present bias, and anchoring that influence decision-making.\\
Heuristics: Mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making but can lead to suboptimal choices.
